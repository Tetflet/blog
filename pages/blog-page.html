    <p>I'm sitting on my couch working through The Odin Project. I learned how to link the <a href="../index.html">index</a> page
        to the <a href="./about-me.html">about me</a> page. Time to add it to the site. Also I'm watching the new with my grandpa
    and an 11, 12, and 14 robbed a bank. What the fuck is this world coming to? Like... kick them in the fucking teeth??? It's 
    literally the only time child abuse is encouraged.</p>

    <p>I have succesffuly set-up my friends old laptop to dual boot with Ubuntu Linux. 
        So far I am enjoying it but I ran into some difficulties. I attempted to install 
        Baldur's Gate 3 in the Linux partition and but everytime I attampet to lauch the game, it 
        gets stuck on the intial loading screen before the main menu. I'm probably going to research it
        tomorrow to see if i can troubl shoot it. </p>
